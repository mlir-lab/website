# MLIR Center of Excellence
## [at the University _of_ Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/)

> This center brings together [people](#people) to conduct research for advancing the [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) compiler ecosystem.
We perform research in fundamental and applied [areas](#areas-of-research) expanding the capabilities and applications of MLIR compiler technology.
We are firmly commited to [Open Source Software](https://opensource.org/docs/definition.php) and [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).
